       1 [ ] Most of existing speech technology work done on this problem is in Speaker Diarization.

       1 [ ] Most Diarzn are not designed for more than 1 simultaneous speakers.
       1 [ ] Motivated to improve SOTA performance, and has been termed as their Achilles' Heel.

       3 [ ] And still does, even with DL-based leaps in conversational ASR.
       3 [ ] The errors are less obvious in ASR wrt WER as most overlaps are single word long.

       3 [ ] Ideal Diarzn is perfect for Conv-Analysts.
       1 [ ] Most proposals train a model-based standalone DT detection system.
       1 [ ] The detections are then used to exclude or attribute second speaker (no details).
       1 [ ] Other approaches \ldots (page 10 of thesis; no details)
       1 [ ] We are not concerned with handling DT, only detecting them, for the Conv-Analysts.

Overlapping speech, also referred to as double-talk,
occurs when more than one speakers speak simultaneously at a given instant of time.
This is a very common occurrence in spontaneous conversations where other participants make an utterance while a speaker is already speaking for many possible reasons,
including non-competitive acknowledgements like â€œmhm" or reactions like laughing,
or competitive interruptions like when having misjudged their turn to speak.
In fact, the occurrence of double-talks can add to the naturalness of a conversation \cite{shriberg_spontaneous_2005,NenkovaHighFrequencyWord2008},
and is a subject of interest in the area of Conversation Analysis while studying the ad-hoc mechanisms by which particpants manage turn-taking during a conversation.
While the frequency and duration of overlaps can vary depending on the situation,
overlaps are quite frequent and characteristically brief (predominently smaller than 1\,second)
during normal, spontaneous conversations.  % TODO: T [fig] for dt-distribution
The characteristically small duration makes annotating them precisely a very expensive manual endeavor for Conversation Analysis,
while attempts to automate the process have found it to be an extremely challenging task.

The flagship scenario of most automated speech technologies is of spontaneous conversations,
and the presence of double-talks is often detrimental to the performance of such technologies when not appropriately handled.
Speaker diarization systems, whose goal is to determine `who spoke when' in a recording with more than one speakers,
are penalized when they miss additional speakers in segments with overlapping speech.
In the increasingly better state-of-the-art performance of such systems,
this penalty has come to account for a major portion of the errors that remain,
so much so that Anguera et al. claim overlapping speech situations to be the `Achilles heel' of speaker diarization systems when applied to recordings of meetings \cite{anguera_speaker_2012}.
Many other speech technologies (e.g. Automatic Speech Recognition) rely on speaker homogenous segmentations produced by a speaker diarization system in a pre-processing step,
and hence also suffer from degraded performance in situations of missed double-talks \cite{cetin_speaker_2006}.

Perhaps consequently, most previous attempts at detecting natural double-talks in conversations have been made in lieu of improving speaker diarization systems.
The most successful approaches propose employing a dedicated and purely acoustic overlap detection system.
The problem has most commonly been formulated as performing frame-wise classification for the presence of either zero (i.e. silence), one, or two (or more) currently active speakers,
and implemented in a GMM-HMM based framework while experimenting with different combinations of acoustic features.  % TODO: T [ref] for all the main ovl in diarzn studies
In general, using additional features from blah, blah, blah, or blah % TODO: T [text] summarize other features
have been found to improve overlap detection over using only spectral features.
Geiger et al. blah blah blah  % TODO: T [text] summarize LSTM-HMM approach.
% TODO: T [search] sweep any new DL-based overlap detection in natural conversations.
The problem of overlap detection has remained unsolved
and continues to present a steep trade-off between precision and recall of the system.

The most potent source of challenge in detecting overlaps is rooted in the inherent imbalance between the three classes.
It can be seen in Table X that in spontaneous conversations,  % TODO: T [tbl] Add table of segment and duration proportions.
while the individual occurrences of natural overlaps constitute a significant proportion of the total number of speaker-homogenous segmentations,
due to their predominently small duration, they account for the smallest proportion of individual frames.
